# Challenge-18-NoSQL-Social-Network-API
## Summary
Using Mongoose and Express, I was tasked with creating and recieving a response from my database. 
+ I can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE responses using Insomnia. I can receive all the information about users and thoughts in my database, as well as adding more users or thoughts to my database. I can also make changes and delete any responses I do or do not need to my users and thoughts.
+ I can also do the same for reactions and friends, but with these, I can add and delete them from my database. My reactions are attached to my thoughts, and my friends are attached to my users.
+ When making this challenge, I thought of it as a social media, where I can make a post and then have some comments on it. And when I have a user, I can see who their friends are and how many they have.
