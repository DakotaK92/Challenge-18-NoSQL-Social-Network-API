# Challenge-18-NoSQL-Social-Network-API
## Summary
Using Mongoose and Express, I was tasked with creating and recieving a response from my database. 
+ I can `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` responses using Insomnia. I can receive all the information about `Users` and `Thoughts` in my database, as well as adding more `Users` or `Thoughts` to my database. I can also make changes and delete any responses I do or do not need to my `Users` and `Thoughts`.
+ I can also do the same for `Reactions` and `Friends`, but with these, I can add and delete them from my database. My `Reactions` are attached to my `Thoughts`, and my `Friends` are attached to my `Users`.
+ When making this challenge, I thought of it as a social media, where I can make a post and then have some comments on it. And when I have a user, I can see who their friends are and how many they have.
